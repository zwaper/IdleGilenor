1. Combat Mechanics
    Monster Stats:
        Each monster has HP, Attack Speed, and Damage. Example:
            Goblin: 10 HP, 1 attack/sec, 2 damage.
            Cow: 20 HP, 0.5 attacks/sec, 3 damage.
            Bosses: 1,000+ HP, AoE attacks, and special abilities (e.g., Lumbridge Goblin Boss summons minions).

    Player Stats:
        Damage/Sec: Determines how fast you kill monsters.
        Defense: Reduces incoming damage (based on armor upgrades).
        Luck: Boosts rare drop chances (from charms/gear).

    Auto-Combat:
        Unlocked via upgrades (e.g., "Auto-Slayer Contract" for 5,000g).
        Progress offline, but at 50% efficiency unless upgraded.

    Death Penalty:
        Lose 10% of current gold if HP hits 0 (unless you have a "Ring of Life" equipped).

--------------------

2. Loot Mechanics
    Drop Tables:
        Every monster has a unique weighted drop table inspired by OSRS. For example:
            Cow Drop Table:
                - Bones (60%)
                - Cowhide (30%)
                - Beef (10%)
            Rare: Cow Mask (1%, B-tier cosmetic).

    Cascading Rarity Rolls:
        Roll for drop tier (e.g., 70% Common, 20% Uncommon, etc.).
        Roll for specific item within that tier.
            Example: Killing a Goblin might first roll a 5% chance for B-tier, then pick between an Iron Scimitar or Steel Dagger.

    Boss Drops:
        Guaranteed 1 rare+ item per kill.
        Boss-exclusive loot (e.g., Lumbridge Goblin Boss drops "Bronze Defender" for +5% defense).

    Pets:
        Ultra-rare (0.001% base chance) but grant passive bonuses.
        Pet Chaos Elemental: +1% luck permanently.
    
    Loot Multipliers:
        Stacking buffs (e.g., "Clover Charm" + "Luck Potion" = +15% rare drops).

--------------------

3. Gold Economy
    Selling Items:
        Common items sell for 1-10g, S-tier for 10,000-100,000g.
        "Sell All" button with filters (e.g., "Sell all C-tier items").
    
    Gold Sinks:
        Exponential upgrade costs:
            -Clover Charm: 500g → 1,000g → 2,000g (each purchase).
        Cosmetics: Unlock OSRS-themed skins (e.g., "Fancy Boots" for 50,000g).

    Prestige Gold Bonus:
        After prestiging, gain +10% gold per region unlocked (stacks multiplicatively).

--------------------

4. Upgrade System
    Upgrades are split into categories:
        Luck:
            - Tiered Charms: +1%/5%/10% rare drop chance.
            - Divine Blessing: Double loot rolls for 10 minutes (costs 1,000g).

        Gear:
            - Weapons (increase damage/sec): Bronze → Iron → Rune → Dragon.
            - Armor (reduce damage taken): Leather → Chainmail → Platebody.

        Automation:
            - Auto-Looter: Collect items without clicking (200g).
            - Slayer Master: Auto-farm monsters for 1 hour (5,000g).

        Prestige Upgrades:
            - Permanent bonuses like "+1% drop chance per prestige".

--------------------

5. Prestige Mechanics
    Requirements:
        - Defeat the region’s boss 10 times.
        - Earn 50,000 total gold (scales with each region).

    Prestige Bonuses:
        - Global Multipliers: +10% gold, +5% drop chance.
        - Region-Specific Bonuses:
            - Lumbridge: +2% pet chance.
            - Varrock: Monsters drop 1 extra item.

    Soft Reset:
        Lose all items, gold, and upgrades BUT keep:
            - Pets
            - Cosmetic unlocks
            - Prestige multipliers

--------------------

6. Progression & Region Unlocking
    New Regions:
        Varrock: Requires Prestige 1.
            - New resource: Coal (used to upgrade smithing gear).

        Wilderness: Requires Prestige 3 + 100 boss kills.
            - Risk: 20% chance to lose items on death.

        Region-Locked Items:
            - You can’t get a Rune Scimitar in Lumbridge—it’s exclusive to Varrock.

--------------------

7. UI/UX Features
    Loot Feed: Live text showing drops (e.g., “Rare! You got a Mithril Sword!”).

    Progress Bars:
        - Boss kill counter (e.g., “Goblin Boss: 7/10 kills”).
        - Region unlock requirements.

    Stats Panel:
        - Track lifetime kills, gold earned, rare drops.

--------------------

8. Monster & Boss Examples
    Lumbridge Goblin Boss:
        - HP: 1,000
        - Mechanics:
            Spawns 3 Goblins every 20 seconds.
            Drops “Goblin Champion’s Ring” (+5% damage to Goblins).

    Varrock Chaos Druid:
        - HP: 5,000
        - Mechanics:
            Throws poison spells (DoT damage).
            Drops “Chaos Rune” (used to craft luck potions).

--------------------

9. Endgame & Long-Term Goals
    Pet Collection: Hunt for all 15 OSRS-themed pets.

    Achievements:
        - “Dragon Slayer”: Kill 1,000 Dragons.
        - “Billionaire”: Earn 1,000,000,000g.

    Leaderboards: Compare prestige tiers and rare drops with others.

--------------------

10. Balancing Considerations
    Exponential Scaling:
        - Monster HP/damage increases by 50% per region.
        - Upgrade costs rise by 20% per purchase.

    Diminishing Returns:
        - Luck bonuses cap at +50% (to prevent 100% S-tier drops).

    Risk vs. Reward:
        - Wilderness has better loot but higher death penalties.

--------------------

Example Player Strategy:
    Grind Lumbridge Goblins to buy “Clover Charm” and “Auto-Looter”.

    Farm the Goblin Boss 10x to prestige.

    Reset, unlock Varrock, and use Prestige bonuses to farm Coal faster.

    Repeat until you can tackle the Wilderness for SSS-tier loot.
