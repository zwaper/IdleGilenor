Core Concept:
    Players grind monsters in region-locked zones (starting in Lumbridge) to collect OSRS-themed items.
    Items are sold for gold to buy upgrades, improving chances for rare drops.
    To unlock new regions (e.g., Varrock, Wilderness), players must prestige, resetting progress but granting permanent bonuses.

--------------------

Gameplay Loop:
    1. Kill Monsters → Get random loot based on OSRS drop tables.

    2. Sell Items → Earn gold to buy upgrades.

    3. Upgrade Gear/Tools → Boost drop rates, stats, or gold gains.

    4. Prestige → Reset progress to unlock harder regions with better loot.

--------------------

Regions & Progression.
Regions are unlocked sequentially by prestiging. Example regions:

    1. Lumbridge (Start)
        Monsters: Goblins, Cows, Chickens
        Boss: Lumbridge Goblin Boss (unlocks prestige)

    2. Varrock (Prestige 1)
        Monsters: Skeletons, Guards, Zombies
        Boss: Chaos Druid

    3. Wilderness (Prestige 3)
        Monsters: Dark Wizards, Black Knights
        Boss: King Black Dragon

Prestige Requirement:
Defeat the region’s boss X times (e.g., 10x Lumbridge Goblin Boss kills).
Prestiging resets your current region progress but unlocks the next zone.

Item Tiers & Drop Rates
Items are categorized by rarity (using OSRS drop rates):

    Common (C-tier): Bones, Coal, Trout (50-80% drop chance)

    Uncommon (B-tier): Mithril Scimitar, Lobster (10-30%)

    Rare (A-tier): Rune Platebody, Dragon Dagger (1-5%)

    Epic (S-tier): Abyssal Whip, Dragon Chainbody (0.1-1%)

    Legendary (SS-tier): 3rd Age Items, Elyisian Spirit Shield (0.01-0.1%)

    Mythic (SSS-tier): Pet Drops (e.g., Pet Chaos Elemental, 0.001%)

--------------------

Gold & Upgrades
Sell items to buy permanent or temporary upgrades:

    1. Luck Boosters:
        "Clover Charm" (+5% rare drop chance)
        "Ring of Wealth" (+10% epic drop chance)

    2. Gear Upgrades:
        Better weapons/armor (e.g., Rune → Dragon) to kill monsters faster.

    3. Prestige Bonuses:
        Permanent multipliers (e.g., +25% gold gain after prestiging).

    4. Auto-Grind:
        Unlock auto-combat for 1 hour (costs gold).

--------------------

Combat & Loot Mechanics
    Each monster has a drop table (e.g., Cow = Hide, Beef, Bones).
    Bosses guarantee a rare+ item on kill.
    Higher-tier regions have tougher monsters but better loot.

--------------------

Prestige Strategy
    Players must decide when to prestige: early for faster progression or later to farm rare items.
    Each prestige adds a region-specific bonus (e.g., Lumbridge prestige = +10% chance for pet drops).
