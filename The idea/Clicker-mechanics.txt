1. Core Idle/Clicker Mechanics
    Active Play:
        Click monsters to deal damage (e.g., 1 click = 1 attack).
        Spam-clicking speeds up kills for instant loot.

    Idle Play:
        Automatically attack monsters over time (e.g., 1 attack every 2 seconds).
        Progress continues offline (at reduced efficiency).

--------------------

2. Automation Upgrades
    Unlock tools to automate grinding:

        Auto-Clicker:
            - Basic: 1 click/sec (costs 500g).
            - Advanced: 5 clicks/sec (costs 5,000g).

        Hirelings:
            - "Goblin Worker": Fights for you, dealing 1 damage/sec (1,000g).
            - "Knight of Varrock": 5 damage/sec (10,000g).

        Auto-Loot:
            - Instantly collects drops without clicking (200g).

        Idle Efficiency:
            - Upgrades improve offline speed (e.g., "Time Warp Charm" doubles offline gains).

--------------------

3. Balancing Active vs. Idle
    Active Play Bonus:
        - Clicking grants +50% loot/gold temporarily (stackable with upgrades).
        - Critical hits: 5% chance to deal 10x damage when clicking.

    Idle Penalty:
        - Offline gains are 50% slower unless upgraded.
        - Can’t fight bosses offline (must click to challenge them).

--------------------

4. Clicker-Specific Features
    Combo Meter:
        - Chain clicks to fill a meter for bonuses (e.g., 100 clicks = +10% drop chance for 30 sec).

    Power Gloves:
        - Clicker upgrades (e.g., "Rune Gauntlets" make each click count as 2 attacks).

    Clicker Achievements:
        - "Finger Crusher": Click 10,000 times → Unlock +1% critical chance.

--------------------

5. Idle-Specific Features
    AFK Mode:
        - Toggle to prioritize specific monsters or loot tiers while idle.

    Offline Earnings:
        - Return to a log showing loot/gold earned while away (e.g., “You AFK’d for 2 hours: 120 Bones, 3,000g”).

    Idle Buffs:
        -"Resting Bonus": After 1 hour offline, gain +20% loot for 10 minutes.

--------------------

6. Prestige Synergy
    Prestige Upgrades for Idle/Clicker:
        - "Ancient Tome of Patience": +25% offline efficiency (permanent).
        - "Berserker’s Fury": +10% click damage per prestige.

    Region-Specific Automation:
        - Unlock "Auto-Boss Killer" in later regions (e.g., Wilderness auto-farms bosses at 50% speed).

--------------------

7. UI Integration

    [ Combat Panel ]
---------------------------------------
    - Goblin (Lv. 2) [HP: 15/50]
        [Click to Attack!]  
        [Auto-Attack: ON/OFF]  

    [ Idle Settings ]  
        - Prioritize: ☑️ Common loot ☑️ Bosses  
        - Hirelings: Goblin Worker (1/3 slots)  

    [ Clicker Stats ]  
        - Clicks/min: 120  
        - Critical Rate: 5%  
        - Combo Meter: ▰▰▰▰▱ (80%) 

--------------------

8. Example Progression Loop
    Early Game: Click frantically to kill Goblins for gold → Buy "Auto-Clicker" to automate basic attacks.

    Mid Game: Unlock Hirelings to idle-farm while you focus on bosses → Use clicker combos for rare loot bursts.

    Late Game: Prestige to boost idle efficiency → Let the game farm high-tier regions overnight.

--------------------

9. Why It Works
    Flexibility: Players choose their playstyle (active, idle, or hybrid).

    Addictive Feedback: Constant rewards from clicking and idle gains.

    Strategic Depth: Prestige upgrades reward long-term planning for both styles.

--------------------

10. New Upgrade Ideas
    Clicker Tree:
        - "Double-Tap Technique": Every 10th click deals 3x damage.
        - "Adrenaline Rush": Clicking speeds up attack rate temporarily.

    Idle Tree:
        - "Masterwork Anvil": Idle attacks have a 1% chance to drop double loot.
        - "Ethereal Courier": Idle loot is automatically sold for +10% gold.

--------------------

11. Monster Interaction Tweaks
    Clicker Bait Monsters:
        - "Chicken Swarm": Requires 50 rapid clicks to defeat but drops bonus feathers.

    Idle-Friendly Monsters:
        - "Rock Crab": High HP but guaranteed loot every 10 seconds (ideal for AFK).

--------------------

12. Boss Mechanics for Hybrid Play
    Lumbridge Goblin Boss:
        - Active Play: Click to dodge AoE attacks (fail = lose 50% HP).
        - Idle Play: Hirelings take 2x longer to kill it, but no risk of death.

--------------------

This turns the game into a "play your way" experience—whether you want to relax with idle gains or go full RuneScape sweatlord with click-spamming.
